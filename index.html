        Some puppies can weigh 2-3 lb, while
        <em>larger ones can weigh up to 15-24 lb</em>. A puppy's coat color
        may change as the puppy grows older, as is commonly seen in breeds
        such as the Yorkshire Terrier.
        <span id="define">Puppy</span> refers specifically to young dogs,
        while "pup" may be used for other animals such as wolves, seals,
        giraffes, guinea pigs, rats or sharks. A
        <span id="define">puppy</span> may just be the best thing this
        planet has evolved. They love everything about you.
